# Mass_Subdomain_Test

Sublists_test is a python script coded to test all subdomains which are enumerated by tools like Sublist3r.                          
It makes pentesters and security researchers work easy.

Though it puts a load on server as it uses nikto and nmap in it but you can edit them to let it work easy.
